# `0.4.0`

Total rewrite of the library with an emphasis on new types. This version
actually makes the library usable and out of the alpha to somewhat of a beta
version. Backward compatibility with the previous versions is no more hence this
changelog starts fresh.

To see the changelog of the previous versions use Git or any time machine.
